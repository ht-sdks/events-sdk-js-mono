### Publishing New Version

This package follows semantic versioning. To publish a new version:

1. Create and push a new git tag matching the format `browser@x.x.x`
   - This will automatically trigger the [Browser Candidate](https://github.com/ht-sdks/events-sdk-js-mono/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-browser-cdn-candidate.yml) workflow which will publish a candidate build to the CDN that you can test locally in an example app.
2. Create a new GitHub Release for the tag created in step 1.
   - A new package will be published to NPM automatically via GitHub Actions. No need to manually bump any versions in `package.json` since the GH Action will automatically set the version based on the git tag.
   - We do recommend bumping the `package.json` version manually if publishing a new **major** version as a way of documenting which major version the code base currently represents, but the published NPM/CDN packages will always use the version parsed from the git tag `browser@x.x.x`
